# APiPy [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/ArtOfCode-/APiPy.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/ArtOfCode-/APiPy)
Python library for using the Stack Exchange API.

-----

APiPy is, as it says on the tin, a Python library for interacting with the [Stack Exchange API](https://api.stackexchange.com).
It's designed to be simple to set up and easy to get started with. There's full documentation available in the docs/ 
directory.

## Get Started
There's one dependency: the `requests` module for Python. Install it first:

    pip install requests --upgrade
    
Then clone the repository to wherever you want it:

    git clone https://github.com/ArtOfCode-/APiPy
    
All set! You can now use it from Python.
